On the Feedback Page http://192.168.99.100/index.php?page=feedback

How to see it
Go on the page mentionned before. Just write script in the name input

THE FLAG IS : 0FBB54BBF7D099713CA4BE297E1BC7DA0173D8B3C21C1811B916A3A86652724E
How to abuse of it
Just by using a simple typo ("script") we can create an XSS fail.

How to patch it
For any return formular you really want to sanitize your return


<svg/onload=alert('XSS')>a

Forms need to be protected from malicious javascript code. This code could be
stored in the database as comments, articles, or any other user input, and
be interpreted by the navigator as javascript code coming from the website

1. Navigate to /index.php?page=feedback
2. Try to inject a <script> tag in the 'comment' field and submit
   - to try to introduce a javascript code in the website. This will give you the flag
